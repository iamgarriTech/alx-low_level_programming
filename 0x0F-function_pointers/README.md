+ [x] 2\. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities<br/>_**[2-int_index.c](2-int_index.c)**_ contains a function that searches for an integer.
+ [x] 3\. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at<br/>_**[3-main.c](3-main.c)**_ contains a program that performs simple operations.
+ [x] 4\. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker<br/>_**[100-main_opcodes.c](100-main_opcodes.c)**_ contains a program that prints the [opcodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opcode) of its own main function.
